Comunicación de una empresa de Multinacional a su personal en Argentina

It has been brought to our attention by several officials visiting our office in Buenos Aires that offensive language is commonly used by our spanish speaking staff. Such behavior, in addition to violating our policy, is highly unprofessional and offensive to both visitors and staff. 
All personnel will immediatly adhere to the following rules:
1. Words like carajo, la puta madre o me da en el quinto forro and other such expressions will not be tolerated or used for emphasis or dramatic effect, no matter how heated a discussion may become.
2. You will not say la cagó when someone makes a mistake, or lo están cagando a pedos if you see someone being reprimended, or qué cagada when a major mistake has been made. All forms and derivations of the verb cagar are utterly innapropiate and unacceptable in our environment.
3. No project manager, section head or administrator under any circumstances will be referred as hijo de mil puta, guanaco, mal parido, es una mierda or es una bosta.
