The interaction between the colloidal particle ranges from a short-ranged steric repulsion and long-ranged Coulomb interaction which depends on the actual system and is in general rather complex. In this experiments, polystyrene spheres are used as colloid which contain many base and acid groups. In solution, some of these groups dissociate such that ions will form that move in a delocalized opposite charged background. Globally, the suspension is still neutral. In a first approximation, this system is comparable to metal system where positive charged ions are surrounded by a delocalized electron gas.
